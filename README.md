# Docker images for Android development

You want to build Android apps on your CI server or just play around with certain Android SDKs?
Then these Docker images could come in very handy!

They are all built and automatically published on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mreichelt/android/) -
check out the list of [tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/mreichelt/android/tags/) available.

## Getting started

To play around with an image locally, install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and run one of these commands:

```bash
# run the minimal image (just Java + sdkmanager)
docker run --rm -it mreichelt/android:minimal

# or run an image with specific SDK installed
docker run --rm -it mreichelt/android:31

# this one also contains the emulator + system image:
docker run --rm -it mreichelt/android:31-system

# or, if you want the newest 3 SDKs (currently 31, 30, and 29):
docker run --rm -it mreichelt/android:latest
```

Check out the list of [tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/mreichelt/android/tags/) and choose the Docker image you need.

## Getting started on GitLab

If you use GitLab, you can set up builds for your Android app in a jiffy. Just add the following `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to your project:

```yaml
image: mreichelt/android:31

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - ./gradlew check assemble
```

That's it! Happy hacking! ðŸ˜Š

## Getting Started on CircleCi

To set up CircleCi builds for your android project based on these images copy the [CircleCI recipe](/recipes/circle-ci/config.yml) into `.circleci/config.yml` of your project - happy building ðŸŽ‰.
